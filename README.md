# AES_crypto

**BACKEND.
I have executed a AES cipher algorithm using python3.6 programming language pycharm community -2022.1 IDE and pycrypto module. The algorithm has  sets of functions that: 1)**generate key. 2) generates Initialization Vector 3)encrypts the source text. 4)decrypts the encrypted text back to source text.

**GETTING STARTED:

To test and run this project, you are required to clone the project in your local machine, install all the dependencies like pycharm community edition IDE, python 3.6 and then execute the related COMMANDS on python shell.Also,note that when whitespaces and line breaks occur,the program automatically fills them with characters denoting the use of strips or replace functions.

**BUILT USING: 
Python version 3.6 programming language.

**BRANCHES IN USE:
